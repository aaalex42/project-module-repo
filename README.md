## Class Demand
Contains several important Functions: 
    - Generation of Demand and Forecast
    - Fulfillment of Demand
    - Service Level
    - average daily machine time

initialize product, rbase and d_fc
len(demand list) - 2*len(forecast list)

### **Function *generate demand and forecast***
    gen_demand_and_fc:
        distribution_int: creates a random variable following lognorm distribution with *d_mue* and *d_varcoef* and appends to demand
        **only** if the pointer to current time is equal to the next event
        **else** demand is 0
        **also** the next event is generating poisson distribution creating a random variable with d_t_mu(number of day) an average between orders
        **until here** is demand generated

nextd - next event
in days where demand is generated

    part0: generate a random number using lognorm with a d_mue and d_varcoef
    part1: from that random number subtract the mean Qty/2
    part2: add the generated demand with part 1*forecast_noise
    part3: round to main r_base
    final part: add the generated forecast to the list by taking first the max between 0 and the generated forecast


### **Function *fulfill***

**Input:** *material, allow_part_shipment*

**Output:** *list of demanded amounts*


    fulfill(mat, allow_part_shipments):
        return material consumed for this step at the beginning, mat_used = 0
        b10 = backlog
    1. handle the backlog as much as possible if material handed down to manage the demand stream ->= backlog
    Then increase the mat_used by backlog decrease the material amount by backlog set backlog = 0
    Else (if backlog is bigger or there is no material increase the material used by material
    decrease the backlog by material  and set material = 0 (all material has been consumed))
    2. Then handle the current demand step and update statistics
        **if** the remaining material >= current demand 
        **THEN** increase the successful demand fulfillments by 1 increase the material used by the current demand
        **ELSE** if there is no fulfillment remaining material, increase failed demand fulfillments by 1
        **if** part shipments are allowed
            then increase the backlog by the difference between current demand and available material
            Increase the used material by the remaining material + set the current material to 0
        **ELSE**(if part shipments are not allowed increase the backlog by the current demand)

    3.  Get rid of the current demand from buffer and save stats
        - Add the current demand to the list of demanded amounts
        - Append the total material used to the list of fulfillments
        - Append the difference between the initial backlog and final backlog to the list of delta backlogs
        - delete the first element from the list of demands which is the current demand


### **Function *average daily machine time***

returns the expected daily machine time consumed by the product:

    1. calculate the daily demand of a product by the ratio/division of the Quantity per Day/number of days on average between 2 orders
    2. Calculate the daily production time by multiplying the daily demand by production time per piece in fractions of day
    3. Calculate EOQ dynamic
    4. calculate the daily setup time by dividing daily demand by eoq and multiplying setup time per batch in fractions of a day
    5. Final step: return the sum of daily production time + daily setup time

### Outside of Demand Class

#### **Function *eoq_static***
returns the Andler formula (constant demand)
Calculates the Andler formula

#### **Function *eoq_dynamic***

calculates either by andler formular on fixed order period

    if mode is chosen Andler
        1. calculate the sum of all demands from demand list
        2. calculate the length of the demand list
        3. calculate the annual demand by multiplying average demand per day and number of days per year
        4. use the above mentioned formula for static eoq
    if mode is FOP:
        1. calculate the minimum between FOP periods and the length of the demand list and then subtract
        2. calculate the sum of the demand list but from the first element until the index calculated in step1

## Class production plan

**Production plan and execution for one machine.**

**Implements :** planning step including reorder point,economic quantity and order scheduling /actual scheduling/production step.

### **Function *plan***


Adds production jobs,"produce" routine eliminates them again.It starts with adding new orders (generating new demand) then takes demand /inventory pipeline and fills the job pipeline.

**Procedures**

*1.Iterate over the demands/inventories queue.*

 1.1. Separate demand and inventory and product in different varieties.
 
 1.2. Generate demand and forecast for 1 day:
   

       If the current inventory level for a product is <= than the reorder point and replenishment due of a product is <= than 0.
       If replenishment open of a product is greater than  o THEN  calculate the EOQ dynamic with the actual demand (only first element ) and the next forecasts.
       for the calculation cost per piece (for eoq), cost per batch and inventory interest (and eoq mode)

       If eoq > 0 
          THEN 1. add a new element to the joblist containing amount =eoq, current date ,inventory (current ) and relevant product.
               2.decrease the replenishment open by the eoq.

### **Function *schedule***

Schedule the joblist using different methods:Value,SPT,LPT, Slip.

    If scheduling regime= Value:
       the joblist is produced not in the ascending order ,but the joblist is then sorted by value = multiplying amount by cost per piece for eoq.
    If scheduling regime = SPT:
       ordering according to Time.
       the joblist is sorted by value= multiplying  the amount by production time per piece 
    If scheduling regime = LPT
       Ordering similar to SPT but in the opposite direction.
    If scheduling regime = Slip
       the joblist is sorted by value =subtracting  the date by (amount multiplied by production time per piece)
       sort the joblist by sorts and ascending value ,eliminate sorts.

### **Function *produce***

 It perform the following points:
 
1. Executes the first Joblist from the list and eliminated the entry.It return the duration of the production job , amount of parts produced and inventory.

    If length of the Joblist is 0
     THEN return 0,0,0 for duration , amount and inventory.
     
2. Place the amount, inventory and product in separate variates and production amount must be greater than 0 .

3. Calculate the duration to produce the given amount by sampling from Log-normal distribution with mean =amount*production time per piece and sigma=varcoef/ âˆš(amount)

4. Increase the production time (total) by the sampled duration.

5. Calculate the setup time by sampling from Log-normal distribution with the mean setup time per batch and sigma, VarCoef (of a machine),But only in the Case if last     product is different than the current one (no setup time needed if the product is the same).

6. Increase the duration of production by the setup time .

7. Add the setup time to the total setup time .

8. Update the last product variable.

9. Delete the first element from the joblist.

10. Return the calculated duration of production Job, the amount produced and inventory.

## Process Wrappers



### **Function *produce***

**Input:** *pp ProdPlan*

**Output:** *None*

It is a process wrapper around production plan, execution part and inventory update.
It runs a production plan (i.e., one machine). Also, it has no bucket, as it continuously processes all jobs pending.

```
WHILE run forever (or until given simulation cycles):
    IF duration of a job > 0:
        THEN:
            Wait this duration to pass
            Store the product after the production is finished (no earlier).
            Decrease the replenishment due by amount. 
        ELSE:
            Wait 15 minutes to prevent infinite loop.
```

### **Function *fulfill***

**Input:** *d Demand, inv Inventory, allow_part_shipments Bool, bucket (**CHECK VAR TYPE**)*

**Output:** *None*

It is a demand fulfillment function for one set of demand and inventory per bucket.

```
WHILE run forever (or until given simulation cycles):
    Get the current inventory level.
    Fulfill the current inventory level (from Demand class).
    Subtract the current inventory level from the inventory.
    Yield timeout Bucket = 1 day (CHECK HERE FOR MORE INFO)
```

> Yield timeout Bucket = 1 day (CHECK HERE FOR MORE INFO)

### **Function *plan***

**Input:** *pp ProdPlan*

**Output:** *None*

Run one planning cycle per bucket (i.e., for 1 machine)

```
WHILE run forever (or until given simulation cycles):
    Plan (from ProdPlan class) at the current time step
    Yield timeout Bucket = 1 day (CHECK HERE FOR MORE INFO)
```

> Yield timeout Bucket = 1 day (CHECK HERE FOR MORE INFO)

---

The process wrappers are executed in the following order:

1. Launch the fulfillment for each product
2. Run planning for a machine
3. Run production for a machine
